// These capabilities may be natively provided by the transport, or they
// may be shimmed via the "connection upgrade" process, which converts a
// "raw" network connection into one that supports such capabilities by
// layering an encryption channel and a stream multiplexer.

// by dialing them, and also lets you listen for incoming connections.
//
// Connections returned by Dial and passed into Listeners are of type

// stream multiplexing and connection security (encryption and authentication).
//
// If a transport implements `io.Closer` (optional), libp2p will call `Close` on
// shutdown. NOTE: `Dial` and `Listen` may be called after or concurrently with
// `Close`.
//
// In addition to the Transport interface, transports may implement
// Resolver or SkipResolver interface. When wrapping/embedding a transport, you should
// ensure that the Resolver/SkipResolver interface is handled correctly.
//
// For a conceptual overview, see https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transport/
